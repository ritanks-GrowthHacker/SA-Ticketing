# Ticket Update Debug Guide

## Current Issues Identified:

### 1. **Status Mismatch Problem**
- AdminDashboard uses: `data.data?.statuses?.ticket` ✅
- ManagerDashboard was using: `data.data?.ticketStatuses` ❌ (FIXED)
- UserDashboard was using: `data.data?.ticketStatuses` ❌ (FIXED)

### 2. **Ticket Data Structure Issues**
- Tickets from dashboard API may have `status` (name) but not `status_id`
- Need to map status names to status IDs from fetched statuses

### 3. **Drag Detection Issues**
- Need proper detection of which column ticket is currently in
- Need proper detection of same-column drops

## Final Test Steps:

1. **Check Browser Console for:**
   - "📊 Ticket Grouping Debug" - Shows how tickets are grouped
   - "🔍 DRAG END - Status Check" - Shows current vs new status
   - "📤 ADMIN: Sending request" - Shows what data is sent to API
   - "📥 ADMIN: API Response" - Shows API response details

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Same column drops should show "⚠️ Same status detected, no update needed"
   - Different column drops should show detailed API request/response

3. **If Still Failing:**
   - Check if ticket IDs are UUIDs or sequential numbers
   - Check if status IDs exist in your database
   - Check if user has permissions to update tickets
